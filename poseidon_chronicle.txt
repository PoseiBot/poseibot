🌊 Sea of Posei: The Sealed God, the Forgotten Civilization

In the abyss of the sea, relics of a forgotten civilization sleep in silence—shattered tridents, broken pillars, fractured shields buried in sand.
The sea envelops these remnants in solemn memory, sealing the ancient world in waves of silence.

At the center stood a god—Poseidon, King of the Sea, the keeper of order in the abyss.
Witnessing the collapse of civilization caused by human arrogance and greed, Poseidon chose to seal himself in the depths.

With his trident plunged into the seafloor, he vanished within a radiant wave of golden light.
The ocean grew silent, and the god’s will sank with him into eternal stillness.

Legends speak of Poseidon’s palace, a grand temple adorned with crystals, coral, and gold.
Homer's Iliad describes it as a palace of gleaming bronze pillars and shell ceilings as soft as clouds.

This sanctuary lies deep within the Sea of Posei—beyond the reach of any human civilization.
It is not merely a structure, but a living heart of ancient energy, the spiritual hub of a sealed world.

Among the civilizations connected to this sacred abyss, Atlantis was the most legendary.
It was not merely a city, but a vast continent and culture that now lies beneath the Sea of Posei, reduced to ruins.

Scattered debris remains—tilted towers, broken statues, golden crowns half-buried in sand.
But within the heart of the deep, something stirs—a pulse of golden energy emanates once again.

The world above decays in its arrogance once more, and the Creator’s fury unleashes a flood.
Tidal waves consume cities and temples. The corrupted age sinks beneath the waters.

The judgment breaks the balance of the deep, cracking the seal that held Poseidon in slumber.
Golden fissures spread across the palace walls, and ancient energy begins to rise once again.

A shaft of light pierces the ocean's darkness and touches the god’s brow—
and with that, Poseidon begins to awaken.

He has not opened his eyes yet. But the sea has already risen.

This is where the Poseidon Chronicle begins.


🌊 Prologue: Nox’s Ark, Balancer of Light

In the beginning, the world was consumed by chaos and greed.
The Creator grieved over mankind’s sins and sent a great flood to cleanse the Earth.

To Noah, a righteous man, the Creator said:
“Build an ark. Save your family and all living creatures, two by two.”

But there were others—fallen ones—who mimicked this divine order and built a second vessel.
Unlike Noah’s, this ark carried not hope, but hunger, violence, and exploitation.

They brought beasts aboard not to protect, but to devour.

That vessel became known as Nox’s Ark, the Ark of Darkness.

As the flood swept over the Earth, Noah’s Ark found refuge upon Mount Ararat.
But Nox’s Ark was swallowed by the storm—lost in the deep, along with its corruption.

Then the Creator called upon the Keeper of the Sea—Poseidon.

“Descend into the depths. Rescue the innocent lives trapped below.”

Poseidon obeyed, descending with his trident into the dark waters.
Among the wreckage of Nox’s Ark, he found wounded creatures still clinging to life.

He carried them to a sanctuary called Suiland, where the Aqua Crystal,
the heart of the ocean, restored their wounds and transformed them into new beings: the Suimonsters.

Born from suffering, reborn with purpose—they became guardians of the deep.

But even in salvation, darkness lingered.
Among the ruins, a flicker of light revealed an intruder: a UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon).
They recovered fragments of Nox’s legacy—hinting at a deeper, interdimensional war.

Poseidon realized this was no longer just humanity’s fall—
it was the beginning of a mythic war across realms.

He grasped his trident and carved a name into a shard of the broken ark:

“THE POSEIDON CHRONICLE”

And thus, the myth began anew.
